# HorseMusic
I guess you could download this. Mostly so SMAPI will shut up about update keys.

What is it?
====
A mod that plays music when you ride your horse for stardew valley. Requires SMAPI 2.6 as a minimum and stardew valley 1.3.

Usage:
====
Unpack to your mods folder and put music in the ``songs`` folder insides the mods folder. The songs must be wav files.
